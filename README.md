Welcome to our github page, where you can find our project code (R) and other useful information. 

### Project description
We investigated the effect of canopy structure on understory plant diversity in pure pine and mixed sitka plantations in the Scottish Cairngorms. Our three main research questions are as follows:

1) How does light availability affect understory plant diversity?
2) Do soil characteristics explain understory plant diversity better than light availability?
3) Is there more diversity in pure Pine plantations compared to mixed plantations?

We predict, that as LAI increases understory diversity decreases; that soil characteristics are do not explain diversity better than light; and that pine plantations would have higher diversity compared to mixed ones.

To do so, we sampled 30 quadrats, accross 6 different sites in the Cairngorms. At each plot, we took measurements of understory richness and abundance (based on the grids within our quadrat), soil characteristics (pH and texture), light availability via hemispherical photography, and surrounding tree species & stand density. 

The data collected allowed us to determine LAI after binarising our images and calculating the pixels of dark aka canopy,  and also diversity from our richness and abundance data using Shannon's diversity index. 

Finally, we analysed our data in R (version 2023.06.1+524), the code for which can be found [here](/Rcode).
